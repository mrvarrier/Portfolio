                <p>Correlate serves as a collaboration platform for several EU Horizon 2020 projects, with a commitment to deliver data archiving functionality by April 2024. While Correlate excels at facilitating real-time collaboration, the platform doesn't inherently support long-term data preservation—a critical requirement for EU-funded research. EU project partners must store their research outputs in approved open-source repositories like Zenodo at the end of their projects to ensure public accessibility and compliance with open science principles. This integration represents both a contractual obligation and a strategic opportunity for Correlate to provide added value for academic and research users.</p>

                        <p>Our research revealed a significant tension between comprehensive metadata collection and user efficiency. EU researchers frequently have back-to-back meetings and limited time to complete administrative tasks like archiving.

                        <p>We discovered a critical user concern regarding permanence. Many researchers were unaware that once documents are published to Zenodo, they cannot be deleted—only new versions can be added.

                        <p>Our initial design challenge centered on how users would access the archiving functionality. We developed two distinct approaches: a file-centric model where users would select individual files for archiving directly from their boards, and a dedicated "My Archive" space that would serve as a central hub for organizing and preparing documents for archiving. The latter approach would require significant changes to Correlate's information architecture but offered more flexibility for bulk operations.</p>

                        <p>One of our biggest challenges was how to handle the technical reality that Correlate doesn't store files directly but only links to them. Our initial solution required a complex flow of temporarily downloading files to our server before uploading to Zenodo. This created concerns about server capacity and potential download failures. After several iterations and technical discussions, we simplified the approach by focusing initially on entire Correlate boards rather than individual files, reducing the complexity of file handling while still meeting user needs.</p>

                        <p>The most challenging aspect of the design was creating an interface for collecting necessary metadata without overwhelming users. Zenodo requires specific fields for publication, but our research indicated users wanted minimal form-filling. I designed a progressive disclosure approach where only the five mandatory fields (Resource Type, Title, Publication Date, Creators, and Access Rights) would be shown by default, with clear visual separation between required and optional fields. We also implemented intelligent defaults where possible—for example, auto-populating the title from the board name and extracting creator information from the user profile.</p>

                    <h3>Critical Design Pivot: Draft vs. Publish</h3>
                    <p>Our initial design assumed users would want to directly publish to Zenodo. However, through usability testing, we discovered significant user anxiety about committing to permanent publication without review. This led to our most important design change: prominently featuring both "Save as Draft" and "Publish" options, with Draft as the default action. This single change dramatically reduced user hesitation and improved confidence in the archiving process.</p>

                        <p>For our MVP, we designed a three-step process: 1) Select content to archive, 2) Input required metadata with smart defaults, 3) Choose between saving as draft or publishing directly. Each step included clear guidance about the implications of user actions, particularly regarding the permanence of publishing. The final design clearly communicated that drafts could be edited later on Zenodo, while publications would be permanent but could have new versions added.</p>

                        <p>A significant technical and design challenge was how to handle Zenodo authentication. We initially considered a deeply integrated approach where users would authorize Correlate to publish on their behalf. However, this raised concerns about permission management and created a complex technical implementation. After several iterations and discussions with stakeholders, we simplified the approach by having users authenticate directly with Zenodo at the point of archiving. While this created an additional step, it provided users with greater clarity about which account they were publishing to and simplified the technical implementation for our April 1st deadline.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS</h2>
                <p>This project presented several significant challenges that required creative problem-solving and iterative design approaches:</p>
                
                <h3 class="section-subtitle">Challenge 1: Technical Limitations</h3>
                <p>Our biggest obstacle was Correlate's architecture—it doesn't store actual files but only links to them. This meant we couldn't directly transfer files to Zenodo as would typically be expected in an integration.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We designed a temporary file handling system where files would be briefly stored on our server during transfer. To minimize server load, we initially limited the functionality to exporting entire boards rather than supporting individual file selection. This simplified the technical implementation while still meeting the core user need of archiving research outputs.</p>
                
                <h3 class="section-subtitle">Challenge 2: User Anxiety About Permanence</h3>
                <p>During testing, we discovered significant user anxiety about publishing documents that could never be deleted from Zenodo.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We prominently featured the "Save as Draft" option as the default action, with clear messaging about the permanence of publishing. This simple change dramatically increased user confidence in the archiving process. We also added informational tooltips explaining the implications of each option and how drafts could be managed later in Zenodo.</p>
                
                <h3 class="section-subtitle">Challenge 3: Tight Timeline</h3>
                <p>With a firm deadline of April 1st, 2024, we had to make pragmatic decisions about scope and feature prioritization.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We adopted a phased approach, clearly defining a minimally viable first version that focused on the most critical functionality: enabling board export to Zenodo with required metadata. Advanced features like bulk individual file selection, AI-generated metadata, and deeper integration were documented and planned for future iterations. This approach allowed us to deliver a valuable solution on time while establishing a foundation for future enhancements.</p>

                <p>The Zenodo integration was successfully launched on April 1st, 2024, meeting our contractual obligation to EU project partners. Initial feedback from users has been positive, with particular appreciation for the simplified metadata form and the clear options between drafts and publishing. Key outcomes include:</p>
                
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px; line-height: 1.6;">
                    <li><strong>Increased archiving activity:</strong> In the first month after launch, over 80 research documents were archived to Zenodo through the integration.</li>
                    <li><strong>High completion rate:</strong> 92% of users who began the archiving process completed it successfully, indicating an intuitive workflow.</li>
                    <li><strong>User satisfaction:</strong> Survey results showed an average satisfaction score of 4.2/5 for the archiving feature.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>This project taught me valuable lessons about balancing technical constraints with user needs. I learned that sometimes simplifying scope and focusing on core functionality can deliver better results than trying to implement every
