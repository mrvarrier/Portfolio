                <p>I worked as a UX Designer in a multidisciplinary team comprising two developers (Kamil and Simona) and one business analyst (Ethan) during HackHarvard 2022.

                        <p>Empath.ly is a video conferencing web application with integrated emotional analytics and real-time emotion identification. During a video call, we analyze the emotions of each user sixty times a second through their camera feed. After the call, a dashboard is available that displays emotional data and data-derived insights such as the most common emotions throughout the call, changes in emotions over time, and notable contrasts or sudden changes in emotion.</p>

                <p>COVID revolutionized the way we communicate and work by normalizing remoteness. It also created a massive emotional drought - we weren't made to empathize with each other through screens. As video conferencing turns into the new normal, marketers and managers continue to struggle with remote communication's lack of nuance and engagement, and those with sensory impairments likely have it even worse. This calls for ways to better understand what is felt throughout a meeting.</p>

                        <p>The first thing I made sure to do is to design the landing page for usability. From research, it was evident that many users have a hard time achieving a defined goal in a platform like Zoom since they are cluttered with options. This, in turn, makes users lose their valuable time and this is very crucial, especially in domains like HR and marketing. So I designed the landing page in such a way that users can easily achieve their goal, i.e., start or join a meeting.</p>

                        <p>There already exists prominent video conferencing platforms like Google Meet and Zoom. This means that there is a design pattern that users are familiar that they are used to. Disrupting that would create a bad experience for the user. To avoid this, I designed a video calling screen similar to that of Google Meet.</p>

                        <p>The biggest challenge faced in this project was how can
                            we present the data of emotions felt throughout the
                            meeting in an effective manner. We need to present data
                            in such a way that any user should be able to look at the
                            data and have an understanding of it. To achieve that I
                            and my team headed to the whiteboard and started
                            ideating on how we can present the data in the best
                            possible manner. We looked at the many existing ways in
                            which data is represented.</p>

                    <h3>Showing data is all good and well, but what is that our target audience is looking for?</h3>
                    <p>While ideating, we explored various ways to present the data, but that wasn't enough. We needed to understand what the target audience truly looks for—specific parameters and insights. To address these questions, I went back to research for deeper clarity.</p>

                            while designing</h3>
                        <p>One thing I realized when I went back to doing research
                            is that many users have back-to-back meetings. This
                            means they do not always have the time to view a
                            detailed breakdown of the data. So I designed this pie
                            chart dashboard that pops up once the meeting ends.
                            This helps the user have a quick understanding of the
                            emotions felt throughout the meeting. In this way, they
                            can quickly understand what they are looking for and
                            hop on to their next meeting.</p>

                            research to features</h3>
                        <p>OThe dashboard was designed in such a way that a user
                            can find any data they want without any difficulty. This
                            was done by keeping simplicity in mind and making sure
                            that the dashboard is scannable. The dashboard has the
                            pie chart shown in the quick overview as users want to
                            see a quick overview even if they can access a detailed
                            breakdown. The second part of the dashboard, the
                            breakdown shows a graph with a timeline so that the
                            user can understand the flow of emotions throughout
                            the meeting. Then comes the final part of the
                            dashboard. The application transcribes the whole
                            meeting and then highlights specific parts of it in which
                            certain emotions spiked. We have these three different
                            ways of presenting ways in the dashboard to meet the
                            user's needs.</p>

                <p>The project ended up winning both overall first place and best life hack track at HackHaravrd and even got selected as one of the top 80 startups among 1500+ startups in India.</p>
                
                <p>The project helped me learn a lot as a UX designer especially when it comes to presenting data and importance of keeping in mind the different scenarios each user have to go through. I also learned how to finish a project under very tight deadlines.</p>
                
                <p>One place the project lacks in is that it is a stand alone web application. There already exist prominent video conferencing platforms such as Zoom and Google meet. So it wouldn't make sense for users to start moving onto a new application. Rather as part of our future work we will start building our application as a zoom plugin rather than a stand alone application.</p>
