                        <p>Empath.ly is a video conferencing web application with integrated emotional analytics and real-time emotion identification. During a video call, we analyze the emotions of each user sixty times a second through their camera feed. After the call, a dashboard is available that displays emotional data and data-derived insights such as the most common emotions throughout the call, changes in emotions over time, and notable contrasts or sudden changes in emotion.</p>

                <p>COVID revolutionized the way we communicate and work by normalizing remoteness. It also created a massive emotional drought - we weren't made to empathize with each other through screens. As video conferencing turns into the new normal, marketers and managers continue to struggle with remote communication's lack of nuance and engagement, and those with sensory impairments likely have it even worse. This calls for ways to better understand what is felt throughout a meeting.</p>

                        <p>From the research, we understood that there needs to be a balance between features and usability. When we talked to users that have used Google meet and zoom they all preferred using zoom because it offers more features, however, they preferred the flow of Google meet. In Google meet they can simply open and use it for what they came for. However, in zoom they are cluttered with a lot of options decreasing its usability</p>

                    <div class="column-right">
                        <p>The first thing I made sure to do is to design the landing page for usability. From research, it was evident that many users have a hard time achieving a defined goal in a platform like Zoom since they are cluttered with options. This, in turn, makes users lose their valuable time and this is very crucial, especially in domains like HR and marketing. So I designed the landing page in such a way that users can easily achieve their goal, i.e., start or join a meeting.</p>

                        <p>There already exists prominent video conferencing platforms like Google Meet and Zoom. This means that there is a design pattern that users are familiar that they are used to. Disrupting that would create a bad experience for the user. To avoid this, I designed a video calling screen similar to that of Google Meet.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="column-right">
                        <p>The biggest challenge faced in this project was how can we present the data of emotions felt throughout the meeting in an effective manner. We need to present data in such a way that any user should be able to look at the data and have an understanding of it. To achieve that I and my team headed to the whiteboard and started ideating on how we can present the data in the best possible manner. We looked at the many existing ways in which data is represented.</p>

                </div>
                
                <p>While ideating, we explored various ways to present the data, but that wasn't enough. We needed to understand what the target audience truly looks for—specific parameters and insights. To address these questions, I went back to research for deeper clarity.</p>

                        <h3>Keeping users' time in mind while designing</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column-right">
                        <p>One thing I realized when I went back to doing research is that many users have back-to-back meetings. This means they do not always have the time to view a detailed breakdown of the data. So I designed this pie chart dashboard that pops up once the meeting ends. This helps the user have a quick understanding of the emotions felt throughout the meeting. In this way, they can quickly understand what they are looking for and hop on to their next meeting.</p>

                    <div class="column-right">
                        <p>The dashboard was designed in such a way that a user can find any data they want without any difficulty. This was done by keeping simplicity in mind and making sure that the dashboard is scannable. The dashboard has the pie chart shown in the quick overview as users want to see a quick overview even if they can access a detailed breakdown. The second part of the dashboard, the breakdown shows a graph with a timeline so that the user can understand the flow of emotions throughout the meeting. Then comes the final part of the dashboard. The application transcribes the whole meeting and then highlights specific parts of it in which certain emotions spiked. We have these three different ways of presenting ways in the dashboard to meet the user's needs.</p>

                <p>The project ended up winning both overall first place and best life hack track at HackHaravrd and even got selected as one of the top 80 startups among 1500+ startups in India.</p>
                
                <p>The project helped me learn a lot as a UX designer especially when it comes to presenting data and importance of keeping in mind the different scenarios each user have to go through. I also learned how to finish a project under very tight deadlines.</p>
                
                <p>One place the project lacks in is that it is a stand alone web application. There already exist prominent video conferencing platforms such as Zoom and Google meet. So it wouldn't make sense for users to start moving onto a new application. Rather as part of our future work we will start building our application as a zoom plugin rather than a stand alone application.</p>
